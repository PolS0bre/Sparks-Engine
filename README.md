# Sparks-Engine
 This is my 3D Graphics Engine made with C++, SDL 2.0 and OpenGL.

 In the main branch is the first (and for the moment only) version of the Sparks Engine, used to do a programmed videoclip.

 The idea of this project is to upgrade it to be a model viewer, where you can import your models and visualize them. When I accomplish this, then I will think what to do next.
